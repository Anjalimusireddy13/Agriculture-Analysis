# Agriculture-Analysis
This project analyzes agricultural data to understand how different crops perform across various seasons. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to highlight seasonal crop trends, production patterns, and yield variations. The insights can help in crop planning, decision-making, and sustainable farming practices.
